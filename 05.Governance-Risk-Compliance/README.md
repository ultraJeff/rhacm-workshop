# Exercise 5 - Governance Risk and Compliance

In this exercise, you will go through the compliance features of Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes. You will apply several policies to the cluster to comply with global security and management standards.

**NOTE!** The exercise depends on the ACM application deployed in the previous exercise (NOT the application deployed using ArgoCD). If the application is not available in your environment, run the following command to deploy it

```
<hub> $ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop/master/04.Application-Lifecycle/exercise-application/rhacm-resources/application.yaml
```

**NOTE!** Ensure the `environment=production` label is associated with one of your managed clusters!

Before creating the policies, create a namespace to populate the CRs associated with RHACM policies.

```
<hub> $ cat >> policies-namespace.yaml << EOF
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: rhacm-policies
EOF

<hub> $ oc apply -f policies-namespace.yaml
```

After the namespace is created, create a PlacementRule resource. We will use the PlacementRule to associate the policies below with all the clusters related to the `environment=production` label.

```
<hub> $ cat >> placementrule-policies.yaml << EOF
---
apiVersion: apps.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementRule
metadata:
  name: prod-policies-clusters
  namespace: rhacm-policies
spec:
  clusterConditions:
    - type: ManagedClusterConditionAvailable
      status: "True"
  clusterSelector:
    matchLabels:
      environment: production
EOF

<hub> $ oc apply -f placementrule-policies.yaml
```

## Policy #1 - Network Security
In this section, you will apply a NetworkPolicy object onto the cluster to limit access to the application you created in the previous exercise. You will only allow traffic from OpenShift’s Ingress Controller in port 8080. All other traffic will be dropped.

The policy you’ll create in this section will use the _enforce_ remediation action to create the NetworkPolicy objects if they do not exist.

We will configure the policy definition in two stages.

### Stage 1 - Deny all traffic to the application namespace

The policy you will configure in this section is enforcing a _deny all_ NetworkPolicy in the webserver-acm namespace on the managed cluster. A _deny all_ NetworkPolicy object example:

```
kind: NetworkPolicy
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: deny-by-default
spec:
  podSelector:
  ingress: []
```

Create a _deny all_ NetworkPolicy object on the managed cluster using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes, by applying the next commands to the hub cluster

```
<hub> $ cat >> denyall-networkpolicy-policy.yaml << EOF
---
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy-networkpolicy-webserver
  namespace: rhacm-policies
  annotations:
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards: NIST SP 800-53
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/categories: SC System and Communications Protection
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/controls: SC-7 Boundary Protection
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  disabled: false
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          name: policy-networkpolicy-denyall-webserver
        spec:
          remediationAction: enforce # the policy-template spec.remediationAction is overridden by the preceding parameter value for spec.remediationAction.
          severity: medium
          namespaceSelector:
            include: ["webserver-acm"]
          object-templates:
            - complianceType: musthave
              objectDefinition:
                kind: NetworkPolicy
                apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
                metadata:
                  name: deny-by-default
                spec:
                  podSelector:
                  ingress: []
---
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-policy-networkpolicy-webserver
  namespace: rhacm-policies
placementRef:
  name: prod-policies-clusters
  kind: PlacementRule
  apiGroup: apps.open-cluster-management.io
subjects:
- name: policy-networkpolicy-webserver
  kind: Policy
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
EOF

<hub> $ oc apply -f denyall-networkpolicy-policy.yaml
```

The above command creates two objects _Policy_ and _PlacementBinding_.

* The _Policy_ objects define the NetworkPolicy that will be deployed on the managed cluster. It associates the NetworkPolicy with the webserver-acm namespace and enforces it.
* The _PlacementBinding_ resource associates the _Policy_ object with the _PlacementRule_ resource created at the beginning of the exercise, allowing the Policy to apply to all clusters with the _environment=production_ label.

After creating the objects, navigate to **Governance** -> **Policies** in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console. Note that the `policy-networkpolicy-webserver` policy exists, and the managed cluster is compliant.

Ensure the policy is effective by trying to navigate to the application once again - **https://&lt;webserver application route>/application.html**. (The application should not be accessible).

To understand the difference between the various _complianceType_ values
 * `musthave` will enforce the object and a subset of the fields
 * `mustonlyhave` will enforce the object with name and all of its fields
 * `mustnothave` will enforce that an object with the same name or labels must not exist

See the [docs](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_advanced_cluster_management_for_kubernetes/2.4/html-single/governance/index#configuration-policy-yaml-table^) for more information.

### Stage 2 - Allow traffic from the Ingress Controller

In this section, you will modify the policy you have created in the previous section. You will add another ObjectDefinition entry to the policy. The ObjectDefinition will apply a second NetworkPolicy object onto the webserver-acm namespace in the managed cluster. The NetworkPolicy object will allow traffic from the Ingress Controller to reach the webserver application in port 8080. An example definition of the NetworkPolicy object:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: NetworkPolicy
metadata:
  name: allow-from-openshift-ingress
spec:
  ingress:
  - ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
  - from:
    - namespaceSelector:
        matchLabels:
          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
  podSelector: {}
  policyTypes:
  - Ingress
```

Adding the NetworkPolicy to the existing policy can be done by running the following command:

```
<hub> $ cat >> networkpolicy-policy.yaml << EOF
---
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy-networkpolicy-webserver

                metadata:
                  name: deny-by-default
                spec:

                  - from:
                    - namespaceSelector:
                        matchLabels:
                          network.openshift.io/policy-group: ingress
                  podSelector: {}
                  policyTypes:
                  - Ingress
---
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:

subjects:
- name: policy-networkpolicy-webserver
  kind: Policy
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
EOF

<hub> $ oc apply -f networkpolicy-policy.yaml
```

After applying the above policy, the application will only be reachable from OpenShift’s ingress controller. Any other traffic will be dropped.

Make sure that the managed cluster complies with the policy by navigating to **Governance** -> **Policies** in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console.

Make sure that the application is now accessible at **https://&lt;webserver application route>/application.html**.

## Policy #2 - Quota Management

In this section, you will apply a LimitRange object to the cluster in order to limit the application’s resource consumption. You will configure a LimitRange object that limits the application’s container memory to 512Mb.

The policy you will create defines the next LimitRange object in the webserver-acm namespace:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: LimitRange # limit memory usage
metadata:
  name: webserver-limit-range
spec:
  limits:
  - default:
      memory: 512Mi
      defaultRequest:
      memory: 256Mi
      type: Container
```

Apply the LimitRange object to the managed cluster using Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes by running the following commands:

```
<hub> $ cat >> limitrange-policy.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: Policy
metadata:
  name: policy-limitrange
  namespace: rhacm-policies
  annotations:
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/standards: NIST SP 800-53
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/categories: SC System and Communications Protection
    policy.open-cluster-management.io/controls: SC-6 Resource Availability
spec:
  remediationAction: enforce
  disabled: false
  policy-templates:
    - objectDefinition:
        apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
        kind: ConfigurationPolicy
        metadata:
          name: policy-limitrange-example
        spec:
          remediationAction: enforce # the policy-template spec.remediationAction is overridden by the preceding parameter value for spec.remediationAction.
          severity: medium
          namespaceSelector:
            include: ["webserver-acm"]
          object-templates:
            - complianceType: mustonlyhave
              objectDefinition:
                apiVersion: v1
                kind: LimitRange # limit memory usage
                metadata:
                  name: webserver-limit-range
                spec:
                  limits:
                  - default:
                      memory: 512Mi
                    defaultRequest:
                      memory: 256Mi
                    type: Container
---
apiVersion: policy.open-cluster-management.io/v1
kind: PlacementBinding
metadata:
  name: binding-policy-limitrange
  namespace: rhacm-policies
placementRef:
  name: prod-policies-clusters
  kind: PlacementRule
  apiGroup: apps.open-cluster-management.io
subjects:
- name: policy-limitrange
  kind: Policy
  apiGroup: policy.open-cluster-management.io
EOF

<hub> $ oc apply -f limitrange-policy.yaml
```

Ensure that the managed cluster complies with the policy by navigating to **Governance** -> **Policies** in the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console.

Make sure that the LimitRange object is created in your managed cluster

* Validate that the LimitRange object is created in the webserver-acm namespace

```
<managed cluster> $ oc get limitrange webserver-limit-range -o yaml -n webserver-acm
```

As the admin user in the managed cluster, try to modify the values of the LimitRange resource (change the memory limit from 512Mi to 1024Mi)

```
<managed cluster> $ oc whoami
admin

<managed cluster> $ oc edit limitrange/webserver-limit-range -n webserver-acm
```

Notice that if you list the LimitRange resource again, the value of the memory limit is back to 512Mi. The 1024Mi value was overridden by the Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management’s policy controller. Changing the LimitRange’s values is only possible by editing the Policy object on the hub cluster.

```
<managed cluster> $ oc get limitrange webserver-limit-range -o yaml -n webserver-acm
...
  limits:
  - default:
    memory: 512Mi
...
```

## Policy #3 - Namespace management

In this section, you will create a policy that `informs` if a namespace with the name `rhacm-dangerous-policy-namespace` is present. Make sure to create the policy in the `rhacm-policies` namespace. You may use the policies you've created in this exercise as a reference for creating this policy.

After deploying the policy, make sure that it is in a `compliant` state.

Create a namespace with the `rhacm-dangerous-policy-namespace` name on the managed cluster. Make sure that a violation is initiated.

```
<managed cluster> $ oc create namespace rhacm-dangerous-policy-namespace
```

Change the remediationAction in your policy to `enforce`. The violation should be remediated.

## Using GitOps

In this section, you will use RHACM’s built-in GitOps mechanism to manage your policies. You will deploy the above policies, and manage them in a GitOps friendly way.

Before you start this exercise section, delete the namespace containing the policies you used in the previous section.

```
<hub> $ oc delete project rhacm-policies
```

1. For this exercise, create a fork of the following GitHub repository - [https://github.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop](https://github.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop)

    As a result, you will have your own version of the repository - [https://github.com/&lt;your-username>/rhacm-workshop](https://github.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop)

2. Afterward, create a namespace on which you will deploy the RHACM resources (Use the namespace.yaml file in the forked repository)

```
<hub> $ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/<your-github-username>/rhacm-workshop/master/05.Governance-Risk-Compliance/exercise/namespace.yaml
```

3. Now, clone the official policy-collection GitHub repository to your machine. The repository contains a binary named **deploy.sh**. The binary associates policies in a GitHub repository to a running Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes cluster.

```
<hub> $ git clone https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection.git

<hub> $ cd policy-collection/deploy/
```

4.a. If you are using the kubeadmin user, create an identity provider by running the next commands (It is not possible to create policies via GitOps using the kubeadmin user). The identity provider will create the `workshop-admin` user:

```
<hub> $ htpasswd -c -B -b htpasswd workshop-admin redhat

<hub> $ oc create secret generic localusers --from-file htpasswd=htpasswd -n openshift-config

<hub> $ oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user cluster-admin workshop-admin

<hub> $ oc get -o yaml oauth cluster > oauth.yaml
```

4.b. Edit the `oauth.yaml` file. The result should look like:

```
apiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1
kind: OAuth
...output omitted...
spec:
  identityProviders:
  - htpasswd:
      fileData:
        name: localusers
    mappingMethod: claim
    name: local-users
    type: HTPasswd
```

4.c. Replace the cluster's identity provider by running the following command:

```
<hub> $ oc replace -f oauth.yaml
```

4.d. Login with the created user

```
<hub> $ oc login -u workshop-admin -p redhat
```

5. Run the following command to allow your username to deploy policies via Git (If you're not using the `workshop-admin` user to run the command, make sure to edit the command in order to associate your user with the `subscription-admin` ClusterRole. Make sure to run the command even if you are using an administrative user!

```
<hub> $ oc patch clusterrolebinding.rbac open-cluster-management:subscription-admin -p '{"subjects": [{"apiGroup":"rbac.authorization.k8s.io", "kind":"User", "name":"workshop-admin"}]}'
```

6. You can now deploy the policies from your forked repository to Advanced Cluster Management.

```
<hub> $ ./deploy.sh --url https://github.com/<your-github-username>/rhacm-workshop.git --branch master --path 05.Governance-Risk-Compliance/exercise/exercise-policies --namespace rhacm-policies
```

7. Make sure the policies are deployed in the **Governance** -> **Policies** tab in the Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes console.

![policies-overview](images/policies-overview.png)


8. Edit the LimitRange policy in [https://github.com/&lt;your-username>/rhacm-workshop/blob/master/05.Governance-Risk-Compliance/exercise/exercise-policies/limitrange-policy.yaml](https://github.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop/blob/master/05.Governance-Risk-Compliance/exercise/exercise-policies/limitrange-policy.yaml). Change the default container limit from 512Mi to 1024Mi.

9. Make sure that you commit and push the change to your fork.

10. Log into the managed cluster. Make sure that the change in GitHub was applied to the LimitRange resource.

```
<managed cluster> $ oc get limitrange webserver-limit-range -o yaml -n webserver-acm
...
  limits:
  - default:
    memory: 1Gi
...
```

## Templating Policies

In this section, you will use RHACM's templating mechanism to create governance policies. In this scenario, you will create an RHACM application. The application deploys a MariaDB database and a Prometheus exporter ([mysqld-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/mysqld_exporter)) that connects to the database and exports metrics.

The mysqld-exporter requires Mariadb's connection information to connect to the database and export the metrics. Since secrets like _database passwords_ can be automatically generated in production environments, a dynamic template might be required to pass such information to the exporter's configuration.

In this scenario, you will pass two templated variables to the mysqld-exporter deployment using a dedicated ConfigMap resource. The variables merge into a single *connection string* the exporter uses to connect to the MariaDB database.

MariaDB Service endpoint - The ConfigMap will populate the mariadb Service resource ClusterIP dynamically. The service endpoint might be different between managed clusters. Using a template in this scenario can help the stability of the system. The `lookup` function identifies the service's ClusterIP - `{{ (lookup "v1" "Service" "mariadb-metrics" "mariadb").spec.clusterIP }}`.
- _mariadb Root password_ - The ConfigMap will provide the connection password dynamically. The password can be different for database instances in multi-cluster environments. Using a template in this scenario can solve inconsistencies between clusters. The `fromSecret` function pulls the password from the `mariadb` secret - `{{ fromSecret "mariadb-metrics" "mariadb" "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"}}`

To further understand the structure of the application, go over the [application resources](exercise/exercise-application). All the application resources are in this directory except the ConfigMap resource, which was created using a templated policy.

The following [templated policy](exercise/exercise-templates/metrics-configmap.yaml) creates the ConfigMap resource that the exporter uses as a connection string:

```
kind: ConfigMap
apiVersion: v1
metadata:
  name: metrics-connection-string
  namespace: mariadb-metrics
data:
  connection_string: 'root:{{ fromSecret "mariadb-metrics" "mariadb" "MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD"}}@({{ (lookup "v1" "Service" "mariadb-metrics" "mariadb").spec.clusterIP }}:3306)/'
```

Deploy the templated policy by running the following command on the hub cluster:

```
<hub> $ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop/master/05.Governance-Risk-Compliance/exercise/exercise-templates/metrics-configmap.yaml
```

The policy will appear on the Governance dashboard in a non-compliant state. The policy depends on the `mariadb` Secret resource and the `mariadb` Service resource. Since you have not created them, the policy cannot create the desired ConfigMap resource.

Deploy the `mariadb-metrics` application to create the MariaDB and exporter instances. Deploy the application by running the following command:

```
<hub> $ oc apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/michaelkotelnikov/rhacm-workshop/master/05.Governance-Risk-Compliance/exercise/exercise-application/rhacm-resources/application.yaml
```

Wait until the application is available. After the application is available, make sure that the policy you have deployed is compliant with the Governance dashboard. Ensure the template works by running the following command on the managed cluster:

```
<managed cluster> $ oc get configmap metrics-connection-string -o yaml -n mariadb-metrics
apiVersion: v1
data:
  connection_string: root:cmVkaGF0@(172.30.14.60:3306)/
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: metrics-connection-string
  namespace: mariadb-metrics
```

Navigate to the URL exported by the `Route` resource in the `mariadb-metrics` namespace. The `Route` exposes the mariadb metrics from the exporter instance.

```
<managed cluster> $ oc get route -n mariadb-metrics
NAME              HOST/PORT                                                                       PATH   SERVICES          PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
mysqld-exporter   mysqld-exporter-mariadb-metrics.apps.cluster-6f0a.6f0a.sandbox664.opentlc.com          mysqld-exporter   9104-tcp   edge          None
```

See your MariaDB metrics by running the following command:

```
<managed cluster> $ curl https://<route>/metrics -k
